## Hi, I'm Shae. Welcome to my Github 🥷🏻

- 🔭 I've recently passed my Investigating Windows Endpoints certification by 13Cubed (forensics) getting the GOLD on my first try!
- 🌱 I love learning new things and practicing my hands-on cyber skills with tools like Splunk, Wireshark and CyberChef to name a few
- ⚡ Fun fact: There is a hacker attack every 39 seconds

- Feel free to check out my [portfolio](https://j1g54w-999.github.io/)
