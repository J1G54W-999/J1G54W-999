## Hi, I'm Shae. Welcome to my Github 🥷🏻

- 🔭 I've recently passed my CySa+ Certificate and am now working on the Investigating Windows Endpoints by 13Cubed (forensics)
- 🌱 Learning everything I can about cybersecurity and working on hands-on skills with tools like Wireshark, Kali Linux, CyberChef etc.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Human error accounts for 95% of all data breaches
