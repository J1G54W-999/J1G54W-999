## Hi, I'm Shae. Welcome to my Github 🥷🏻

- 🔭 I’m currently studying for me CySa+ and working on scripting (HTML, CSS and JavaScript)
- 🌱 Learning everything I can about cybersecurity and working on hands-on skills with tools like Wireshark, Kali Linux, CyberChef etc.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The first ever "computer bug" was literally a bug (a moth that caused a malfunction in the Harvard Mark II computer in 1947)

- Feel free to check out my [portfolio](https://j1g54w-999.github.io/)
