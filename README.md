## Hi, Welcome to my Github ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Python scripting, Splunk and Regex
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything I can about cybersecurity and working on hands-on skills with tools like Wireshark, Kali Linux, CyberChef etc.
- âš¡ Fun fact: The first ever "computer bug" was literally a bug (a moth that caused a malfunction in the Harvard Mark II computer in 1947)
